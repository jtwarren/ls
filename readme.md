# LearnSprout coding challenge
## Part 1
Last summer my friend Vishnu, a medical student at UCSD, decided to learn programming like many others his age. He wanted to learn programming to broaden his horizons and bring his own ideas to life through apps and websites. Excited by his new intellectual venture, Vishnu tried using a variety of different resources - CodeAcademy, One Month Rails, Khan Academy, and many others. However, none of them worked. Time and again, he would get stuck, and frustrated as he tried to parse through challenging new material without any help from others. Unlike how he learned throughout his life, this time he didn't have anyone to answer his questions, point him to the right resources, and check his understanding. In seeing this, I realized that Vishnu is representative of a large group of people who don't learn best on their own and are being left behind by online education. He, like so many of us, thrives when he has someone there to help him understand the beauty and the intuition behind what it is he is learning. Learning alone, with no one there to communicate with, is unnatural, difficult, and ineffective for him.

LearnTo's solution to the problem is simple and elegant - we connect people who are interested in learning a topic with people in the same area who are passionate about sharing their knowledge on that topic. In connecting people who want to learn and share, LearnTo recreates the physical, in person, learning experience that all of us have grown up with. As such, it provides much needed support to the scores of people who want to learn new things and aren't effective at simply learning on their own. 

I am particularly proud of working on LearnTo (http://www.learnto.com/). I began working on this project with my friend, Dhruv. We came into this past semester with an idea (and a domain name :P), discussed many approaches, and built a website in around 4 days. We launched our website in November and within just one month we had over 180 user sign ups, 100 lesson requests, and 70 lessons happen or scheduled to happen.  We were accepte into MIT's 100k Accelerate program and we are going for another huge push over Janary.
