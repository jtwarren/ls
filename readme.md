# LearnSprout coding challenge
## Part 1
One project that I am particularly proud of working on is LearnTo (http://www.learnto.com/).  As the problem is described below, our solution is to facilitate the connection of people who want to learn with those willing and able to teach.  I began working on this project with my friend, Dhruv.  We came into the semester with an idea (and a domain name :P), discussed many approaches, and built a website in over 4 days.  We launched our website in November and within just one month we had over 180 user sign ups, 100 lesson requests, and 70 lessons happen or scheduled to happen.

### The problem
Last summer my friend Vishnu, a medical student at UCSD, decided to learn programming like many others his age. He wanted to learn programming to broaden his horizons and bring his own ideas to life through apps and websites. Excited by his new intellectual venture, Vishnu tried using a variety of different resources - CodeAcademy, One Month Rails, Khan Academy, and many others. However, none of them worked. Time and again, he would get stuck, and frustrated as he tried to parse through challenging new material without any help from others. Unlike how he learned throughout his life, this time he didn't have anyone to answer his questions, point him to the right resources, and check his understanding. In seeing this, I realized that Vishnu is representative of a large group of people who don't learn best on their own and are being left behind by online education. He, like so many of us, thrives when he has someone there to help him understand the beauty and the intuition behind what it is he is learning. Learning alone, with no one there to communicate with, is unnatural, difficult, and ineffective for him.
